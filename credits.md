================

The **Genius Lyrics Tidy Data Extractor** web application extracts lyrics from [Genius](https://genius.com/) and allows for users to download this data in a [tidy format](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf).  It was created by [Jarren Santos](https://dasil-jarren.github.io/) (Data Scientist @ [DASIL](https://dasil.sites.grinnell.edu/), [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu/)), using the `shiny` R package that interacts with the Genius API using the `genius` R package by [Josiah Parry](https://github.com/JosiahParry/genius).
